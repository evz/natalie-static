<p>This nine week long workshop empowers couples to have a family-centered birth in the hospital or home setting. This class will provide you with the resources and support you need to confidently and consciously prepare for birth and your transition to parenthood. Each week's class will focus on a particular topic such as the stages of labor, how to address fears and concerns of giving birth and becoming a parent, partner support and communication during the birth and how to care for your newborn. Every week couples will learn hands on techniques to help them during labor. Included in this series is a comprehensive Breastfeeding Basics class. The final session will be a potluck celebration where couples from previous classes come back with their newborns to share their birth stories and parenting experiences. Childbirth Prep is appropriate at 20 weeks and beyond.</p>
